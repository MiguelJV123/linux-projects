# 🐧 My Linux Learning Projects

This repo is my personal journey into the Linux world — one project at a time.  
Each mini-project gets a bit harder than the last, teaching something new about scripting, networking, automation, or system internals.

Right now I’m building the first 10 projects, and I’ll keep adding more as I level up.
